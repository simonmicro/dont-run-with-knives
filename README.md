# Don't run with Knives!

> If you experience fall damage with swords, you are doing it wrong!

*A Fabric mod, which punishes falling with knives (swords) in Minecraft*

## What is this?

A **Fabric** mod, which punishes falling with knives (swords) in Minecraft. The extra damage applied to the player upon falling while holding at least one sword is calculated as follows (added together for each held sword):

*extra damage = already received fall damage * (swords max-damage / diamond-swords max-damage) + sharpness damage*

Furthermore, if any sword had the "fire aspect"-enchantment it will then also applied to the player. Burning hot!
